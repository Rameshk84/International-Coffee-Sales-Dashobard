**10 business recommendations to increase customers and sales******

1. Expand Marketing in Underperforming Countries
Countries like Ireland and the United Kingdom show lower sales compared to the United States. Launch targeted advertising campaigns in these regions to boost brand awareness and customer acquisition.
2. Introduce Global Promotions for Loyalty Program
The Loyalty Card feature can be heavily promoted to attract and retain more customers. Offering exclusive discounts, early access to products, and free samples to loyalty cardholders can encourage repeat business.
3. Seasonal Promotions Based on Sales Trends
Identify months with spikes in sales and introduce seasonal promotions or limited-time offers to capitalize on periods of high demand. This could help increase overall sales volume during peak months.
4. Focus on Top-Selling Products in Marketing Campaigns
Highlight the most popular coffee types like Arabica and create campaigns to cross-sell or upsell other coffee types like Robusta or Liberica.
5. Upsell Larger Product Sizes
Offer incentives (e.g., discounts, free shipping) for customers to buy 1.0 kg or 2.5 kg sizes rather than smaller sizes. This can help boost overall sales value per transaction.
6. Leverage Top Customers for Referral Programs
Your Top 5 Customers can be incentivized to refer others by offering referral bonuses or discounts. Use this word-of-mouth marketing strategy to grow your customer base.
7. Segment Product Offerings by Country Preferences
Tailor product offerings based on the preferences in different regions. For example, promote certain roast types (e.g., Medium or Dark roasts) in countries where they are more popular, ensuring local taste preferences are met.
8. Create Exclusive Offers for Corporate and Bulk Buyers
Design a pricing structure and special deals for corporate or bulk orders, as larger orders could increase total sales volume significantly. Explore partnerships with businesses, offices, and cafes.
9. Enhance Online and Social Media Presence
Increase digital marketing efforts through platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Google Ads to reach more coffee lovers globally. Highlight product variety, sales, and customer testimonials to drive traffic and conversions.
10. Introduce New Product Variants or Limited Editions
Launch limited-edition coffee flavors, new blends, or exclusive collections that encourage customers to try something new. Creating urgency through limited-time offers can drive quicker purchasing decisions and increase customer engagement.
